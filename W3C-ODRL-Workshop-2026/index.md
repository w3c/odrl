## Overview

The **W3C Workshop on ODRL** will bring together industry adopters, implementers, researchers, standards contributors, and community members to explore and set the future state of the **ODRL** roadmap.

ODRL is a W3C Recommendation for expressing interoperable usage control policies for digital content, services, and data. Adoption is rapidly increasing across data spaces, trusted data ecosystems, digital media standards, the cultural sector, financial data and governance frameworks. 

Currently, ODRL is managed by the [W3C ODRL Community Group](http://www.w3.org/community/odrl/) that develops new profiles and best practices guides for the [W3C ODRL Information Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/) and the [W3C ODRL Vocabulary](https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-vocab/) recommendations.

This workshop aims to:
- Explore new communities adoping ODRL
- Share real-world implementation experiences  
- Highlight tooling and policy evaluation approaches  
- Identify technical gaps and new research challenges  
- Explore future roadmap directions for ODRL

## Why This Workshop?

Since becoming a W3C Recommendation in 2018, ODRL has gained increasing recognition and adoption across:

- Data space governance frameworks  
- Industry consortia and interoperability initiatives  
- Digital media and content standards  
- Usage control and compliance systems  

At the same time, important challenges remain:

- Policy interoperability across domains  
- Runtime enforcement and compliance verification  
- Profile development and extension governance  
- Tooling maturity and usability  
- Integration with emerging Web standards  

This workshop provides a forum to examine these topics collaboratively and define next steps.
