For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image (\"synching\") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this Licence.\r\n\"Licence\" means this Creative Commons England and Wales Public Licence agreement.\r\n\"Original Author\" means the individual (or entity) who created the Work.\r\n\"Work\" means the work protected by copyright which is offered under the terms of this Licence.\r\nFor the purpose of this Licence, when not inconsistent with the context, words in the singular number include the plural number.\r\n2.
