**Scenario 1 Policy Monitoring**: 
Various autonomous agents interact in an open interaction system and perform various types of actions. These actions, with their type (e.g. a payment), various parameters (who paid, how much they paid, etc.) and the time instant at which they are done, are digitally represented in a '**system state**'. A set of norms (N) regulate the behaviour of those agents. Policy monitoring consists of automatic computation of fulfilment or violation of norms in N based on the actions of agents.

**Goal 1: Check whether the behavior of agents that is constrained by ODRL policies is compliant with those policies**

**Scenario 2 Access Control to digital resources**:
Access control policies can be used to determine access by users or software agents to digital resources. This is particularly important in decentralised systems where the users are the entities responsible to grant or deny access to the data and are responsible to define or adhere to a set of policies that satisfy their preferences. By using these policies in an algorithm to match with incoming access requests for data, a system can provide a fine-grained access control mechanism to its users.

**Goal 2: Match access requests with ODRL policies determining access control to stored digital resources**

**Core differences between these scenarios**:

*Difference 1.*

In an open interaction system, described in Scenario 1, it is assumed that agents are free to perform all actions, even prohibited ones. The performance of a prohibited action implies a violation. In this scenario, a permission is an exception to a prohibition. 
 
In Scenario 2, if an agent does not have permission to access certain data, it will not access the data, the prohibition is regimented and cannot be violated.

*Difference 2.*

In Scenario 1, policies are focused on duties and consequences of agents performing certain actions, while in Scenario 2, the agents establish constraints, e.g. purpose, recipient, temporal or spatial constraints, for the specific action of granting access to certain resources or types of resources.

--------------------------------------------------------------

The semantics of an ODRL policiy is given by the semantics of its rules. The semantics of one ODRL Rule is expressed by:

1. Its **activation condition**: when something happens or a certain state of affairs is satisfied the rule becomes active or in force. In ODRL 2.2 the activation condition must be expressed by specifying the conditions applicable to a Rule by means of a set of constraints.
2. The **class of actions** regulated by the rule: when an instance of the class of actions regulated by the rule is performed with all refinements satisfied, the rule is fulfilled or violated on the basis of its type.
3. Its **type**: if the rule is a duty (or obligation), performing an instance of the **class of actions** regulated by the rule brings about a fulfillment. If the type is prohibition, performing an instance of the class of actions regulated by the rule brings about a violation. If the type is permission ...

In order to check whether the **activation condition** is satisfied it must be evaluated on the **state of the world**.

In order to check whether an individual belonging to the  **class of actions** regulated by the rule is actually performed there must be an individual in the **state of the world** that belongs to the class of actions. 

Therefore it is crucial that the activation condition and the class of actions regulated by the rule are expressed with an **ontology** that can be aligned or matched with the **ontology** used for expressing the state of the worl.

**PROBLEMS OF ODRL 2.2**

**PROBLEM 1**: 
In ODRL 2.2 the **class** of actions regulated by one rule is expressed using an **individual** belonging to the odrl:Action class and the class of actions is constrained using a refinement (which is an instance of the odrl:Constraint class). It is not easy to automatically translate such an expression (an individual) into the description of a **class** of actions regulated by the rule. Therefore, it is not easy to perform a class membership test for computing the fulfillment or violation of the rule. 

**PROBLEM 2**: Defining a new constraint language is not one of the goals of the ODRL working group, it is better to reuse an existing one.

**PROBLEM 3**: When a new Rule is formalized using ODRL 2.2, in the definition of its Refinement component, it is possible to use a leftOperand propery that is not meaningful for the action refined, for example it is possible to use the "version" leftoperand for the "display" action. 

**Running Example 1**

Suppose we want to write the policy that contains the following rule: "the permission for everybody to display the movie http://example.com/asset:9898.movie in Germany" (this example is taken from Example 1.2A in https://w3c.github.io/odrl/bp/#examples): 

``` 
{
 "@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl.jsonld",
 "@type": "Set",
 "uid": "http://example.com/policy:1010",
 "permission": [{
 	"target": "http://example.com/asset:9898.movie",
	"action": "display",
	"constraint": [{
           "leftOperand": "spatial",
           "operator": "eq",
           "rightOperand":  "https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q183",
	   "comment": "i.e Germany"
       }]
 }]
}
```
       
**SOLUTION TO PROBLEM 3**:  

Define the following ontology for expressing the rules inside policies and the state of the world where the real actions of the agents are represented:
 - the odrl:Display class is sublcass of the odrl:Action class
 - the object property odrl:spatial has as domain the class odrl:Action and as range a class odrl:State
 - the object property odrl:target has as domain the class odrl:Action (instead of odrl:Policy or odrl:Rule).

For example the ontolgy could contain the following information: 
- Robert performs a display action of the movie 9898.movie in Germany. 
- Anna performs a display action of the movie 9898.movie in Switzerland.
  
 **Solution TO PROBLEM 1 and 2**:
 
Use SHACL (Shapes Constraint Language) for describing the class of actions regulated by one ODRL Rule. 
References for SHACL: https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl; https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl-af/#rules

This is a SHACL shape that checks whether a focus node (in this case any instance of type odrl:Display class) conforms to the **state constraints** (having as target "http://example.com/asset:9898.movie" and being performed in Germany):

```
ex:SampleShape a sh:NodeShape ;
        sh:targetClass odrl:Display ;
        sh:property [
                sh:path odrl:spatial ;
                sh:hasValue "Germany" ;
                sh:minCount 1 ;
                sh:maxCount 1;
        ] ;
        sh:property [
                sh:path odrl:target ;
                sh:hasValue <http://example.com/asset:9898.movie>;
                sh:minCount 1 ;
                sh:maxCount 1;
        ] .
```

If it is required to get all actions that conform to those constraints (and not use any of SHACL's Advanced Features https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl-af/#SPARQLTarget) it is possible to get them like this:

```
ex:SampleShape a sh:NodeShape ;
        sh:targetClass odrl:Display ;
        sh:not [
                sh:and (
                  [
                    sh:property [
                      sh:path odrl:spatial ;
                      sh:hasValue "Germany" ;
                      sh:minCount 1 ;
                      sh:maxCount 1;
                    ]
                 ]
                 [
                   sh:property [
                    sh:path odrl:target ;
                    sh:hasValue <http://example.com/asset:9898.movie>;
                    sh:minCount 1 ;
                    sh:maxCount 1;
                ]
            ])
        ] .
```
i.e. state the negation which leads to all actions being reported that actually do conform to your initial query. (cf https://s.zazuko.com/2reFCP)

**OPEN PROBLEMS**:
 - How to connect a rule with a SHACL expression for expressing the **activation condition** of the rule; (For example for formalizing that the permission in Example 1 is valid between the first and the fifth of July 2022).

- How to connect a rule with a SHACL expression used to formalize the **class of actions regulated by the rule**; Is it ok to treat it as a text?

- How to use a SHACL expression for constraining an asset or a party like in ODRL 2.2?

- What ontology do we want to use for formalizing the ODRL examples? (for example is it possible to use the ODRL2.2 vocabulary?).
