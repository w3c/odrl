            <h2>Introduction</h2> 	
            <p> <!-- definition of ODRL -->
                    The Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL) is a policy expression language that can be used to represent permitted, prohibited, and obligated actions over a certain asset. 
            </p>
            <p> <!-- reference of official ODRL-documents -->
                    The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/#infoModel">ODRL Information Model</a> formally defines the core abstract concepts of the model and their properties by means of an OWL 2 Ontology (available at <a href="https://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/">https://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/</a>), which is described in the ODRL <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-vocab/">Vocabulary & Expression</a> specification. This document does not contradict these documents, and its interpretation is subordinate to theirs.	
            </p>
            <p> <!-- the use of ontologies -->
                    The ODRL ontology can be used as a data model to represent machine-readable Policies and associate them with digital or analog assets. By using a machine-readable language to represent policies, ODRL implementations can provide useful functionalities such as those of a policy search engine, a policy compatibility checker, an access control system, a monitoring system, or a policy planning system, among others.
            </p
            <p> <!-- the need for clarifying the semantics, the need for this document -->
		    
However, neither the specification of the model (in a text form) nor the vocabulary (in an OWL ontology) accurately describes the behaviour of an <b></b>. 

<!-- objective of the evaluator -->
The objective of an <b>ODRL Evaluator</b> is to determine: 
<ul>
  <li>which Permissions, Prohibitions, and/or Obligations (collectively named Rules) are <b>active</b> in a given instant of time with respect to a given state of the world. 
  A Rule is said to be active if it is in effect;</li>
  <li>If an action, described in the evaluation request, is permitted by a Permission;</li>
  <!--<li>which Permissions have been <b>used</b>;</li>-->
  <li>which Prohibitions and Obligations have been <b>violated</b> or <b>fulfilled</b>.</li>
</ul>

This document describes the expected behaviour of an ODRL Evaluator, with a textual description and a collection of examples.
	
<p> <!-- definition of the evaluator -->
When the <b>ODRL Evaluator</b> evaluates Permissions, it is expected to work in at least one of these two scenarios:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Access control scenario</b>: the ODRL Evaluator determines the access by users or software agents to digital resources
            considering a set of policies, the state of the world, and the description of the action that a user 
            <b>requests</b> to perform on certain digital resources. It may be useful to distinguish between 
	    requested and <b>attempted</b> action. When an agent attempts to perform an action, 
            e.g., an agent double-clicks on a picture, if the action is not permitted the attempt is recorded 
	    and if it is the case sanctioned. 
	In the case of a request, only the answer is generated: either the action is permitted or the action is denied.
	    </li>

            <li><b>Policy monitoring scenario</b> (also known as compliance checking or usage control): given a set of policies and the description of the 
	   state of the world that includes the actions actually <b>performed</b>, the ODRL Evaluator has to determine 
	whether obligations or prohibitions have been fulfilled or violated by the performance of 
            certain actions, and which permissions are active.</li>
        </ol>

<p> 
The ODRL Evaluator uses as <b>input</b>:
</p>
			
	<ol> <!-- input of the Evaluator -->
	  <li>a Policy;</li>
	  <li>a formal description of the State of the World;</li>

		This section describes the State of the World, the Evaluation Request, the Behaviour, and the Evaluation Report.
    The <a href="https://spec.knows.idlab.ugent.be/sotw/latest/">ontologies</a> used for representing the State of the World, the Evaluation Request, and the Evaluation Report
	are only illustrative and other ontologies and expressions can be used, but in order to ensure
	interoperability between different systems, the results of the evaluation must be the same.
  
<h3>State of the World</h3>
        <p><!-- state of the world --> 
            The ODRL Evaluator requires a formal representation of the <b>state of the world</b>.
            The state of the world specifies knowledge representing real-world information that aids the evaluation of ODRL Policies.
            <!--For example, a certain state of the world may include the current date and time, the location of agents, or the history of performed actions.-->
        </p>
<p>	In this document, we aim to provide a minimal set of information that needs to be represented in the 
    State of the World:
</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>SotW</code>: knowledge representing real-world information aiding the evaluation of ODRL Policies;</li>
			<li><code>context</code>: the contextual information related to the state of the world.</li>
		</ul>
        
<h3>Evaluation Request</h3>
<p>
An ODRL Evaluator requires an <b>Evaluation Request</b> as input.
An Evaluation Request may represent a formal description of an action to be evaluated and 
it contains the following properties:
</p>
<ul>
 	<li><code>evaluatedAction</code>: The action to be evaluated (e.g., <code>odrl:use</code>, <code>odrl:read</code>, <code>odrl:modify</code>).</li>
    <li><code>evaluatedParty</code> (compulsory): The party (e.g., person or organization) being evaluated in relation to the evaluated action.</li>
    <li><code>evaluatedTarget</code>: The asset (e.g., file, document, data, service) being evaluated in relation to the evaluated action.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Additional contextual information can also be included in the Evaluation Request, e.g., temporal information or 
a purpose for exercising the requested action. The <code>requestParameter</code> property MAY be used
to associate an <code>odrl-fs:EvaluationRequest</code> with additional contextual information, 
i.e., the <code>RequestParameter</code>. The following properties are available to describe a <code>RequestParameter</code>:
<ul>
<li><code>describesFeature</code>: Describe the data feature that is being assessed in the request parameter.</li>
<li><code>value: The concrete value attributed to the data feature.</code></li>
</ul>	

<section id="behaviour">	
            <h3>Behaviour</h3>
            
            <p>
                An evaluator might take as an optional input a parameter that specifies the behaviour of the system 
                in case a requested/attempted action is neither permitted nor prohibited by the Policy input.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this case, the behaviour input can have three values:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>open</code>: in case of an open system, anything that is not prohibited is permitted;</li>
                <li><code>closed</code>: in case of a closed system, anything that is not permitted is prohibited;</li>
                <li><code>default</code>: the default value is closed.</li>

    <section id="sectionPolicies">	
        <h2>Semantics of Policies</h2>	
        <p> <!-- Subclasses of policies -->
            There are three ODRL Policy subclasses (Agreement, Offer, Set), plus four non-normative ODRL Policy subclasses (Assertion, Privacy, Request, Ticket). Direct instances of the <code>odrl:Policy</code> class must be understood as policy <code>odrl:Set</code> policies. This subsection describes how are these policies to be understood in relation to semantics.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A <code>odrl:Set</code> policy must be considered by an ODRL Evaluator. The <code>odrl:Set</code> is not necessarily linked to <code>odrl:Offer</code> nor <code>odrl:Agreement</code>.<br></li>
            <li>An <code>odrl:Offer</code> policy must not be considered by an ODRL Evaluator. It is created by an <code>odrl:Assigner</code> as a mere proposition.</li>
            <li>An <code>odrl:Agreement</code> policy must be considered by an ODRL Evaluator as any other <code>odrl:Set</code> policy. It represents the accord between (<i>at least</i>) one <code>odrl:Assigner</code> and a <code>odrl:Assignee</code>. An instance of <code>odrl:Agreement</code> may have a way for the <code>odrl:Assigner</code> to trace to its related <code>odrl:Offer</code>.</li>
        </ul>

	<p>Before providing the semantics of an ODRL Policy that may contain one or more Rules, 
	we have to provide the semantics of the different types of ODRL Rules: Permission, Prohibition, and Obligation.</p>


    <section id="sectionPermissionsProhibitionsObligations">	
        <h3>General semantics of Rules</h3>	
        <p> <!-- Relation with deontic logic -->
            The deontic modalities of permissions, prohibitions and obligations can be represented in ODRL as instances of the classes 
            <code>odrl:Permission</code>, <code>odrl:Prohibition</code> and <code>odrl:Duty</code>.
        </p>
        <p>Instances of the class <code>odrl:Duty</code> may have the following different meanings: Obligation, Condition, Consequence or Remedy. Instances of the class <code>odrl:Constraint</code> may have the meaning of: Constraint or Refinement.
        </p>
        <p>
            The concepts (objects) to be understood by an ODRL Evaluator therefore include: Policy, Permission, 
		Prohibition, Obligation, Condition (Duty), Consequence, Remedy, Refinement, 
		Constraint, State of the World, and Evaluation Request. 
            Here follows a list of properties (with their possible values) needed by the ODRL Evaluator:</p>
        <ul> <!-- attributes of the main objects -->
            <li>Permission, Prohibition, Obligation, and Condition (Duty) have a property called 
            <b>activation state</b>, which can take the values of <b>active</b> or <b>inactive</b>.</li>

            <li>Prohibition, Obligation, and Condition (Duty) have a property called <b>deontic state</b>, 
            which can take the values of <b>not-set</b>, or <b>violated</b>, or <b>fulfilled</b>.
            They can become violated or fulfilled only when they are active. <br>
	    An active prohibition can be violated many times by different actions, 
	    therefore when a prohibition is violated it is required
	     to register the action that brings to the violation. <br>
	    </li>

	    <li>Permission has a property called <b>control state</b>, which can take the values of <b>permit</b> or 
	    <b>deny</b> of a specific action.</li>

            <li>Constraint (connected to the Rule using the odrl:constraint property) has a property called
            <b>satisfaction state</b> which can take the values of <b>satisfied</b> or <b>not-satisfied</b>. 
            A not-satisfied constraint may become satisfied and return to being not-satisfied.
            The value of the satisfaction state of a Constraint is calculated according to the <b>state of the world</b>.
            Constraints directly defined at policy level are not directly considered.</li>

            <li>Refinement (connected to an Action, to an AssetCollection, or to a PartyCollection using the 
            odrl:refinement property) has a property called <b>satisfaction state</b> 
            which can take the values of <b>satisfied</b> or <b>not-satisfied</b>. 
	    The value of the satisfaction state of a Refinement is calculated according to the Evaluation Request.
           			
           <!-- <li>Action (connected to the Rule with the odrl:action property) has a property called <b>performance state</b> 
            which initially takes the values <b>not-performed</b> and 
            can become <b>performed</b> when an action with all the properties values (i.e. <code>type</code>, 
                    <code>performer</code>, <code>object</code>,...)  that matches with the values
            described in the Rule (i.e. <code>action</code>, <code>assignee</code>, <code>target</code>) 
                    is actually performed at a given instant of time and its performance is represented 
                    in the state of the world.</li> -->
	
            </ul>

<p> <!-- out of scope -->
<!-- Nicoletta: I agree that we REMOVE this part because the computation of the satisfaction of Constraints and 
	Refinement has to be realized by the ODRL Evaluator.
<!--		
            The process for computing:
	<ul>
		<li>the satisfaction state of Constraints with respect to the state of the world; </li>
		<li>the satisfaction state of Refinement with respect the action and the state of the world;</li>
                <li>the performance state of an Action with respect to the state of the world</li>
	 </ul>
	 may be realized by another component (independent from the ODRL Evaluator). 
	The crucial point is that given these values, all ODRL Evaluators should agree on the 
	    value of the activation state and deontic states of the rules.
-->
        </p>

        <p>
            The mechanisms for computing the activation of Permissions, Prohibitions, and Obligations and the violation or 
            fulfillment of Prohibitions and Obligations are all different. Therefore we continue by discussing the semantics of 
            Permissions, Prohibitions, and Obligations in separated sections.
        </p>

    <section id="sectionPermissions">
        <h2>Semantics of Permissions</h2> 
<p>
	In ODRL 2.2 a Permission can be limited by duties, like making a payment, we call these <b>Conditions</b>.
	It can also be limited by <b>Constraints</b> (in time, in space, etc.). 
        In addition, the definition of the permitted action, the asset, and the party collection can be refined with <b>Refinements</b>. 
        The evaluation of these Conditions (duties) and Constraints determine whether the Permission is active 
	(i.e., it permits the performance of an action that belongs to the class of action regulated by the permission
	and that satisfies all the refinements) or not.  

        <!--The evaluation of permission activation is different in the access control scenario that in the monitoring scenario.-->
	Permissions can be evaluated in two different scenarios: access control or monitoring.
</p>
	 <p>
            In the <b>access control scenario</b>: when an action is <b>requested</b>,
            the activation of permissions is computed. 
	    If there is an active permission that permits such an action with all refinements satisdied, 
	    then action is permitted.
	    If there is not an active permission that permits such an action with all refinements satisdied, 
	    then action is denied.
        </p>

	     <p>
            In the <b>monitoring scenario</b>: when an action is <b>performed</b>, it is represented in the state of the world.
            When the performace of the action has to be evaluated with respect to the permissions.
	    If the performed action belongs to class of actions regulated by the active permission and all the refinements satisfied
	    then the action is permitted by the permission.
	    If the performed action does not belong to class of actions regulated the permission or the permission is inactive 
	    then the action is not permitted by the permission.
	    
	   <!-- REMOVED JULY 2025 if there is no active permission to do such an action (with all refinements satisfied) and the default 
	    setting for the ODRL Evaluator is set to "everything is prohibited unless explicitly permitted" a 
	    violation should be generated. <br>-->
	<br>
	
	<!--In the monitoring scenario, the value of the satisfaction state of a Refinement is computed according to the actual actions that are performed by the agents and that are
            represented in the state of the world. The satisfaction of the Refinement is NOT used for computing the activation of the Permission.-->
		     
        </p>

	    
        <!--<h3>Expected behaviour of the ODRL Evaluator</h3>-->
        <p> 
	<!-- definition of active permission (a permission is an instance of the class <code>odrl:Permission</code>)-->
       	<!-- definition of active/inactive -->
		
        The ODRL Evaluator computes that a Permission is <b>active</b> iif:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>All the existing Constraints of the Rule are satisfied AND;</li> 
            <li>All the existing Conditions (duties) of the Rule are fulfilled or inactive; </li>
        </ol>

            A permission may have its action limited (in time, in space, etc.) without any Condition (Duty) or Refinement.
            This is the situation of the following case (similar to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/#constraint-rule">Example 13</a> 
            in the ODRL Information Model 2.2). The permission below allows the target asset <code>document:1234</code> to be distributed, 
            it includes the constraint that the permission may only be exercised until 2018-01-01. 
            The permission is granted by the organization <code>party:16</code>.

        <p>
        The ODRL Evaluator has to calculate first the activation state of the permission. 
	The constraint must be evaluated on the state of the world, which must include a representation of the current time.
        As long as the current time is before the first day of 2018, the Permission is active. When the first day of 2018 
	is passed, the Permission is inactive. The action class regulated by the permission is <code>distribute</code>, the target is <code>document:1234</code>, and the assignee is not specified.

            The example below (similar to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/#duty-perm">Example 22</a> in the ODRL Information Model 2.2)
	is a Permission that is constrained by a Condition (Duty). The Condition does not have Constraints and its action has a refinement. 
	This permission is granted by <code>party:sony</code> for <code>party:billie</code> to play the  
            target asset <code>music:1999</code>. The permission includes the Condition to perform the compensate action that has a refinement of <code>payAmount</code> 
            of euro 5.00. The semantics of Permission requires that the compensate action (included in the duty) must be performed 
            <b>before</b> the play action in order to get an <code>active</code> permission to perform the play action.

<h2>Semantics of Prohibitions</h2> 		

In ODRL 2.2., a Rule that belongs to the <b>odrl:Prohibition</b> class is <b>active</b> (its action, with all refinements satisfied
cannot be exercised) if all Constraints of the Rule are satisfied, otherwise it is <b>inactive</b>.<br> 

In order to evaluate if a prohibition is active, it is necessary to evaluate the satisfaction of its Constraints on the state of the world.<br>

An ODRL Evaluator will determine that a violation has been produced if the action regulated by an active prohibition is performed. 
If multiple actions are related to a single prohibition, the execution of a single action will result in a violation. 
The ODRL Evaluator will calculate the <b>deontic state</b> of an <b>active</b> prohibition to be within one of these possibilities:
    <ul>
    <li> <b>not-set</b> when the regulated action with all refinements satisfied has not been performed; </li>
    <li> <b>violated</b> when the regulated action with all refinements satisfied has been performed; </li>
    </ul>
A prohibition may include an <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/#duty-prohib"><code>odrl:remedy</code></a> for its violation. <br><br>

        <h4>Evaluation of a prohibition with constraints</h4>
        <p>
            <b>Example description</b>
        </p>
        <p> 
            This is example is similar to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/#prohibition">Example 19</a> in the Information 
            Model, with the differences that it has not a related permission and it has a Constraint. In this case, there is a prohibition that is constrained by a constraint.
            The policy below is a formal Agreement between two parties (the assigner and the assignee) that the action of archiving the specified digital asset is prohibited.
            The prohibition is specifically active before the first day of 2025.

        </p>
        <p>
            In this example, the Constraint must be evaluated on the state of the world. 
	As long as the current time is before the first day of 2025 the Prohibition is active. 
	After that date the Prohibition is inactive. 
	When the prohibition is active, a violation occurs if the prohibited action is performed.

<h2>Sematics of Obligations</h2> 	

    In ODRL 2.2., an Obligation that belongs to the <code>odrl:Duty</code> class (it would be better to have an <code>odrl:Obligation</code> class) is <b>active</b> (its action,  
    with all refinements satisfied, should be perfomed) if all constraints of the Rule are satisfied, otherwise it is <b>inactive</b>.<br> 
    An active Obligation becomes:
    <ul>
    <li> <b>fulfilled</b> when the regulated action with all refinements satisfied is performed; </li>
    <li> <b>violated</b> when the regulated action with all refinements satisfied can no longer be performed; </li>
    <li> <b>not-set</b> when the regulated action with all refinements satisfied can be performed but has not been so far. </li>
    </ul>
    An obligation may include an <code>odrl:consequence</code> of not fulfilling that obligation. <br><br>

            It describes an obligation that is not constrained by a Constraint. The policy below is a formal Agreement between two parties (the assigner and the assignee) that the action to compensate

            <h2>Scenarios</h2>

            <h3>Policy Monitoring</h3>
                    <p>Various autonomous agents interact in an open interaction system and perform various types of actions. 
                    These actions, with their type (e.g. a payment), various parameters (who paid, how much they paid, etc.) 
                    and the time instant at which they are done, are digitally represented in a <b>'world state'</b> or 'system state'.<br>
                    (What model of data (ontology) is used for representing the state of the world?)</p> 

                    <p>A set of ODRL policies (P) regulate the behaviour of those agents, every policy contains some rules (R) that are prohibitions, duties, or permissions.</p>

                    <p><b>Policy monitoring</b> (or compliance checking) is a continuous process that consists of computing at every instant of time:</p>
                    <ul>
                            <li>the set of permissions that are valid (i.e. check if all constraints are satisfied and if all duties are fulfilled);</li>
                            <li>the set of obligations or prohibitions that are active (i.e. checking if all constraints are satisfied);</li>
                            <li>the set of active obligations or prohibitions that are fulfilled or violated by the performance of certain actions 
                                    (i.e. check if the performance of an action matches the action regulated by an <b>active</b> obligation or a <b>active</b> 
                                    prohibition taking into account all the refinements used for describing the action in the policy;</li>
                    </ul>	

                    <p>Monitoring or compliance checking are useful, for example, for being able to:</p>
                    <ul>
                            <li>Check if I am compliant with the policies in which I am involved as a debtor. For example, a company needs to check if 
                            the behaviour of its employees is compliant with the policies attached to the digital assets used inside the company.</li>
                            <li>Check if the policies in which I am involved as a creditor are violated. For example, I can attach to a picture 
                            the prohibition to sell it and I would like to automatically monitor if the actions performed on that picture are 
                            compliant with such a prohibition.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Simulation may be used by consumers for a what-if analysis and evaluate if the performance of an action on a digital asset will 
                    I violate one of its policies.<br>
                    In this scenario, it is assumed that agents are free to perform all actions, even prohibited ones. 
                    A permission is interesting when it is an exception to a prohibition.</p>

            <h3>Access Control</h3>

            <p><b>Goal:</b> Match access requests with ODRL policies determining access control to stored digital resources</p>

            <p>Access control policies can be used to determine access by users or software agents to digital resources.</p>
            <p>This is particularly important in decentralised systems where the users are the entities responsible to grant or deny 
                    access to the data and are responsible to define or adhere to a set of policies that satisfy their preferences.</p>
            <p>By using these policies in an algorithm to match incoming access requests for data, a system can provide a 
                    fine-grained access control mechanism to its users.</p>				
            <p>In this scenario, if an agent does not have permission to access certain data, it will not access the data, 
                    the prohibition is regimented and cannot be violated.</p>
            <p>Typically in this scenario, the entities responsible to grant or deny access to the data would write <code>odrl:Offer</code> policies 
                    (or new types of policies can be created, e.g., preference, requirement). The agent trying to access the data 
                    would write <code>odrl:Request</code> policies and the final agreement between the parties can be stored as an <i>odrl:Agreement</i> 
                    (associated with the <code>odrl:Offer</code> and <code>odrl:Request</code> policies).</p>

            <h3>License composition</h3>
                    <p>Two resources differently licensed ("policed") need to be integrated in a new work.
                    Which range of policies will be compatible with these two previous policies?
                    Are these two policies compatible at all?
                    The works of Governatori, Villata et al., DALICC and many others addressed this problem, but their results and ideas were never incorporated into ODRL.</p>

            <h3>Validation</h3>
                    <p>ODRL is being used in a Language Resource Data Portal. Anybody can freely upload a resource, and anybody can post ODRL policies 
                    associated to them. The ids of the content resources and the assigners are verified, but the rest is left to the users.
                    However, if they upload broken or malicious policies, they could break the system (e.g. a policy with 1 million rules).
                    How to validate the ODRL policies so that they are conformant with a limited subset of them?
                            <a href="http://odrlapi.appspot.com/">ODRL Validator and Evaluator Sandbox</a></p>

            <h3>Planning</h3>
                    <p>I want to do an action, I don't have permission to do it, what do I have to do to get permission to do it?
                    Which is the sequence of messages to be exchanged within a protocol?</p>
