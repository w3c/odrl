		<h2>Introduction</h2> 	
		 The Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL) is a policy expression language that can be used to represent permitted and prohibited actions over a certain asset, 
		 as well as obligated actions.<br>
			
		The ODRL <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/#infoModel">Information Model</a> formally defines the core abstract concepts (classes) of the model and their 
		properties by means of an OWL 2 Ontology (which is available in various format at <a href="https://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/">https://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/</a>).<br>
			
			The ODRL ontology can be used to write <em>machine-readable</em> policies (sample policies are available here <a href="https://w3c.github.io/odrl/bp/">https://w3c.github.io/odrl/bp/</a>)
		and associate them to digital assets. The advantage of representing policies with a machine-readable language is that you can provide certain useful services 
                on policies, e.g. you can <em>search</em> for policies that meet certain criteria, you can easily retrieve all the permissions a user has on a given 
		picture or all the prohibitions associated to a movie.<br>
			
		There are other types of services that would be useful to provide on a set of ODRL policies. They are described below in the <em>Scenarios</em> section. 
		In order to automatically provide those services on a set of policies we need to be able to formally specify their <em>meaning</em>, i.e.: we need to be 
		able to automatically compute if:
			<ul>
				<li>a prohibition has been infringed by an action being exercised;</li>
				<li>an obligation is fulfilled by an action being exercised or it is violated by an action not being performed;</li>
				<li>a permission is valid and allows an action to be exercised.</li>
			</ul>
		
		The meaning of having an ORDL permission, prohibition or duty is specified as follows:		
			<ol>
				<li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/#prohibition">Prohibition</a>: 
					A Prohibition disallows an action, with all refinements satisfied, to be exercised on an Asset if all constraints are satisfied.</li>
				<li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/#duty-policy">Duty</a>: 
					A Duty is the obligation to exercise an action, with all refinements satisfied. A Duty is fulfilled if all constraints are satisfied and if its action, with all refinements satisfied, has been exercised. 
				<li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/#permission">Permission</a>:
					A Permission allows an action, with all refinements satisfied, to be exercised on an Asset if all constraints are satisfied and if all duties are fulfilled.</li>
			</ol>
		</section>

		<h2>Scenarios</h2>
			
		<h3>Policy Monitoring</h3>
			<p>Various autonomous agents interact in an open interaction system and perform various types of actions. 
			These actions, with their type (e.g. a payment), various parameters (who paid, how much they paid, etc.) 
			and the time instant at which they are done, are digitally represented in a <b>'world state'</b> or 'system state'.<br>
			(What model of data (ontology) is used for representing the state of the world?)</p> 
			
			<p>A set of ODRL policies (P) regulate the behaviour of those agents, every policy contains some rules (R) that are prohibitions, duties, or permissions.</p>
			
			<p><b>Policy monitoring</b> (or compliance checking) is a continuous process that consists of computing at every instant of time:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>the set of permissions that are valid (i.e. check if all constraints are satisfied and if all duties are fulfilled);</li>
				<li>the set of obligations or prohibitions that are active (i.e. checking if all constraints are satisfied);</li>
				<li>the set of active obligations or prohibitions that are fulfilled or violated by the performance of certain actions 
					(i.e. check if the performance of an action matches the action regulated by an <b>active</b> obligation or a <b>active</b> 
					prohibition taking into account all the refinements used for describing the action in the policy;</li>
			</ul>	
									
			<p>Monitoring or compliance checking are useful, for example, for being able to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Check if I am compliant with the policies in which I am involved as a debtor. For example, a company needs to check if 
				the behaviour of its employees is compliant with the policies attached to the digital assets used inside the company.</li>
                        	<li>Check if the policies in which I am involved as a creditor are violated. For example, I can attach to a picture 
				the prohibition to sell it and I would like to automatically monitor if the actions performed on that picture are 
				compliant with such a prohibition.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Simulation may be used by consumers for a what-if analysis and evaluate if the performance of an action on a digital asset will 
			I violate one of its policies.<br>
			In this scenario, it is assumed that agents are free to perform all actions, even prohibited ones. 
			A permission is interesting when it is an exception to a prohibition.</p>
			
		<h3>Access Control</h3>

		<p><b>Goal:</b> Match access requests with ODRL policies determining access control to stored digital resources</p>

		<p>Access control policies can be used to determine access by users or software agents to digital resources.</p>
		<p>This is particularly important in decentralised systems where the users are the entities responsible to grant or deny 
			access to the data and are responsible to define or adhere to a set of policies that satisfy their preferences.</p>
		<p>By using these policies in an algorithm to match incoming access requests for data, a system can provide a 
			fine-grained access control mechanism to its users.</p>				
		<p>In this scenario, if an agent does not have permission to access certain data, it will not access the data, 
			the prohibition is regimented and cannot be violated.</p>
		<p>Typically in this scenario, the entities responsible to grant or deny access to the data would write <code>odrl:Offer</code> policies 
			(or new types of policies can be created, e.g., preference, requirement). The agent trying to access the data 
			would write <code>odrl:Request</code> policies and the final agreement between the parties can be stored as an <i>odrl:Agreement</i> 
			(associated with the <code>odrl:Offer</code> and <code>odrl:Request</code> policies).</p>
				
		<h3>License composition</h3>
			<p>Two resources differently licensed ("policed") need to be integrated in a new work.
			Which range of policies will be compatible with these two previous policies?
			Are these two policies compatible at all?
			The works of Governatori, Villata et al., DALICC and many others addressed this problem, but their results and ideas were never incorporated into ODRL.</p>
				
		<h3>Validation</h3>
			<p>ODRL is being used in a Language Resource Data Portal. Anybody can freely upload a resource, and anybody can post ODRL policies 
		        associated to them. The ids of the content resources and the assigners are verified, but the rest is left to the users.
			However, if they upload broken or malicious policies, they could break the system (e.g. a policy with 1 million rules).
			How to validate the ODRL policies so that they are conformant with a limited subset of them?
				<a href="http://odrlapi.appspot.com/">ODRL Validator and Evaluator Sandbox</a></p>

		<h3>Planning</h3>
			<p>I want to do an action, I don't have permission to do it, what do I have to do to get permission to do it?
			Which is the sequence of messages to be exchanged within a protocol?</p>

<h2> Semantics of Permission, Prohibition, and Obligation</h2>	
	Previous proposal of an ODRL evaluator: <a href="https://www.w3.org/2016/poe/wiki/Evaluator">https://www.w3.org/2016/poe/wiki/Evaluator</a>.<br><br>

	<b>Goal of this section</b>: define an ODRL Evaluator, the task of an ODRL Evaluator is to determine, given a particular state of the world 
	(represented using the classes and properties defined in a specific ontology), which Permissions, Prohibitions, and Obligations are <b>active</b> and 
	whether or not performing a certain action leads to <b>violations</b> or to <b>fulfillments</b>.<br><br>

	Permissions, Prohibitions and Obligations, collectively named Rules, can be <b>active</b> or <b>inactive</b>. 
	When Obligations and Prohibitions are active can become <b>violated</b> or <b>fulfilled</b>. 
	Active, inactive, violated, and fulfilled are called <b>deontic states</b>.<br><br>	
	
	The <b>deontic state</b> of Permissions, Prohibitions, and Obligations is determined by the status of the Duties, by the status of the Constraints it references, 
	and by the status of the refinement of their Action, the refinement of the Asset Collection, the refinement of the Party Collection. <br>
	The status of Constraints (connected to the Rule using the odrl:constraint property) is <b>satisfied</b> or <b>not satisfied</b>.<br>
	The status of the refinement of an Action (connected to the Action using the odrl:refinement property) is <b>satisfied</b> or <b>not satisfied</b>. 
	The status of the refinement of an Asset Collection (connected to the Asset Collection using the odrl:refinement property) is <b>satisfied</b> or <b>not satisfied</b>.
	The status of the refinement of a Party Collection (connected to the Action using the odrl:refinement property) is <b>satisfied</b> or <b>not satisfied</b>.<br><br>
	If all the refinements are satisfied it means that the action described by the rule has been <b>performed</b>.
	
	The process for computing the satisfaction of constraints and the satisfaction of refinements with respect to the state of the world is left to 
	individual implementations. But given these values, all ODRL Evaluators should agree on the deontic state of Permissions, Prohibitions, and Obligations 
	and on the violations and fulfillments generated.

	<hr>
	
	The deontic modalities of <b>Permissions</b>, <b>Prohibitions</b> and <b>Obligations</b> can be represented in ODRL as instances of the classes 
	<code>odrl:Permission</code>, <code>odrl:Prohibition</code> and <code>odrl:Duty</code>.<br>
	Instances of the class <code>odrl:Duty</code> may have different meanings in ODRL.
	<ul>
		<li>An instance of the class <code>odrl:Duty</code> represents an <b>Obligation</b> when it is connected to the <code>odrl:Policy</code> through the <code>odrl:obligation</code> property. 
		An Obligation can be activated, violated, or fullfilled.</li>
		<li>An instance of the class <code>odrl:Duty</code> represents a condition for a <b>Permission</b> to be active when it is connected to the odrl:Permission 
		through the odrl:duty property.
		When an instance of the <code>odrl:Duty</code> class is used as an activation condition of a Permission, it can be active, fulfilled or not fullfilled.
		This is a crucial difference between a Duty that represents an activation condition of a Permission and a Duty that represents an Obligation.
		</li>
		<li>An instance of the class <code>odrl:Duty</code> represents a consequence (<i>sanction</i>) when it is connected to the <code>odrl:Duty</code> 
			through the <code>odrl:consequence</code> property. </li>
		<li>An instance of the class <code>odrl:Duty</code> represents a remedy for a odrl:Prohibition when it is connected to the <code>odrl:Duty</code> 
			through the <code>odrl:remedy</code> property. </li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	
	A Rule (Permission, Prohibition, Obligation) is said to be <b>active</b> if its <b>activation condition</b> holds. 
	The activation condition is different for Permissions, Prohibitions and Obligations (constraints directly defined at policy level are not directly considered):
	<ul>
		<li>A <b>Permission</b> rule is active if the rule constraints are satisfied and the duties connected to 
			it through the property <code>odrl:duty</code> are fulfilled.</li>
		<li>A <b>Prohibition</b> rule is active if the rule constraints are satisfied.</li>
		<li>An <b>Obligation</b> rule is active if the rule constraints are satisfied.</li>
	</ul>
		
<h3>Sematics of Permission</h3> 
	
	In ODRL 2.2., a Rule that belongs to the <b>odrl:Permission</b> class is <b>active</b> (the action is permitted) if:
	<ul>
		<li>all constraints of the Rule are satisfied AND</li> 
		<li>all its duties are fulfilled. </li>
	</ul>
	If one of those two conditions is not met, the Permission is <b>inactive</b>.<br> 
	
	In a system it is crucial to detect the <b>violations</b>. If the default setting for the ODRL Evaluator is: 
	"everything is prohibited unless explicitly permitted", whenever an action is performed the ODRL Evaluator has to check if the action was permitted or not. 
	This can be done by evaluating for every active permission if the action performed satisfies the permission refinements 
	(action, target, and assigner properties). <br>
	If all the refinements are satisfied then the permission is used. <br>
	If one of the refinements is not satisfied the action is not permitted by the permission under examination. <br>
	If the action is not permitted by at least one of the permissions then there is a <b>violation</b>.<br>
		
<h4>Sematics of Duty when it is used as an activation condition of a Permission</h4> 

Goal: determine if a Duty is fulfilled.<br>

In ODRL 2.2., a Rule that belongs to the <b>Duty</b> class is <b>fulfilled</b> if all constraints are satisfied and if its action, 
with all refinements satisfied, has been performed. <br>

	The initial state of a duty is <b>inactive</b> if it has at least one Constraint. The initial state of a duty is <b>active</b> if it has not Constraints.<br>
	In order to evaluate if a duty is fulfilled, it is necessary to perform the following steps:
<ol>
	<li> Evaluate the satisfaction of its constraints (output: satisfied, not satisfied) on the state of the world; if its constraints are all satisfied
	the duty becomes <b>active</b> (which is equal to <b>not fulfilled</b>). </li>
		
	<li>If the duty is <b>active</b> and one of its constraints becomes not satisfied the duty becomes <b>inactive</b>.
	(For example, the duty to pay a ticket to enter a museum may be active only on Sundays.).</li>
	
	<li> If the duty is active and its action with all refinements satisfied, is performed the duty becomes <b>fulfilled</b> otherwise remains active/not fulfilled.
	Once a duty is fulfilled, it cannot become active/not fullfilled.</li>
</ol>

The life cycle of a duty is depicted in the figure below:

	
<hr>		
	<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/#duty-perm">Example 22</a> (from the ODRL Information Model 2.2).<br>
	
	The Party http://example.com/assigner:sony makes an Offer to play the target asset http://example.com/music/1999.mp3. 
	The permission includes a duty for the compensate action that has a refinement of payAmount of euro 5.00.
	The semantics of Permission requires that the compensate action (included in the duty) must be performed <b>before</b> to get an active permission.
	(In <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/#duty-perm">Example 22</a> this temporal requirement is represented with a constraint of the duty, but it is useless).
	The general formulation of Example 22 is: the Permission P1 has a Duty D1 and an Action A2 (play the file). 
	The Duty D1 has not a constraint. D1 has an Action A1 (compensate) that is refined by constraint R1 (5 euro):
	
	<table border="1">
  	<tr>
    		<th>ID</th>
    		<th>D1.R1</th>
		<th>D1</th>
		<th>P1</th>
		<th>P1.A2</th>
		<th>Violations</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>E22-1</td>
    <td>not satisfied</td>
    <td>active/not fulfilled</td>
    <td>inactive</td>
    <td>performed</td>	  
    <td>depends on default setting and other permissions</td>	  
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>E22-2</td>
    <td>satisfied (performed)</td>
    <td>fulfilled</td>
    <td>active</td>
   <td>performed</td>
   <td>No (P1 is used).</td>
  </tr>
</table>

	<hr>

	<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/#duty-perm">Example 22-bis</a> 
	we add a constraint C1 to the duty D1, the compensate action is required only on Sundays.<br>

	
	
<h3>Sematics of Prohibition</h3> 		

In ODRL 2.2., a Rule that belongs to the <b>odrl:Prohibition</b> class is <b>active</b> (its action, with all refinements satisfied
cannot be exercised) if all constraints of the Rule are satisfied, otherwise it is <b>inactive</b>.<br> 

In order to evaluate if a prohibition is active, it is necessary to evaluate the satisfaction of its constraints on the state of the world (constraints are either satisfied or unsatisfied). <br>

Duties on prohibitions have no defined meaning.<br>

An ODRL Evaluator will determine that a violation has been produced if the action on an active prohibition is executed. If multiple actions are related to a single prohibition, the execution of a single action will result in a violation. The ODRL Evaluator will calculate the state of the prohibition to be within one of these possibilities:
	<ul>
	<li> <b>not violated</b> when the regulated action with all refinements satisfied has not been executed; </li>
	<li> <b>violated</b> when the regulated action with all refinements satisfied has been executed; </li>
	</ul>


A prohibition may include an <code>odrl:consequence</code> for its violation. <br>


<h3>Sematics of Obligation</h3> 	
	
	In ODRL 2.2., an Obligation that belongs to the <code>odrl:Duty</code> class (it would be better to have an <code>odrl:Obligation</code> class) is <b>active</b> (its action,  
	with all refinements satisfied, should be perfomed) if all constraints of the Rule are satisfied, otherwise it is <b>inactive</b>.<br> 
	An active Obligation becomes:
	<ul>
	<li> <b>fulfilled or not violated</b> when the regulated action with all refinements satisfied is executed; </li>
	<li> <b>violated</b> when the regulated action with all refinements satisfied can no longer be executed; </li>
	<li> <b>unknown</b> when the regulated action with all refinements satisfied can be executed but has not been so far; </li>
	</ul>
	An obligation may include an <code>odrl:consequence</code> of not fulfilling that obligation. <br>
	
	<b>Problem</b>: reasoning about deadline.

<h3>Documents on "formal semantics" in W3C specifications</h3>
			
	The W3C has produced several "Semantics" documents each of them with a different objective.

	<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-mt/">RDF1.1. Semantics</a> defines a model-theoretic semantics to determine the validity of RDF inference processes. A similar approach is followed by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-direct-semantics/">OWL Semantics</a>, a recommendation providing the direct model-theoretic semantics for OWL 2 and definingthe most common inference problems.</p>

	<p>XPath (XML Path Language) is a language that can be used to navigate through elements and attributes in an XML document, and it also has <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xquery-semantics/">formal semantics</a>. XQuery (XML Query) is a query and functional programming language to query XML data. The "XQuery and XPath Formal Semantics"  intends to complement the specification by defining the meaning of XQuery/XPath expressions with mathematical rigor; thus clarifying the intended meaning of the English specification, and ensuring that no corner cases are left out. For that regard grammar productions are given.</p>

	<p>The POWDER specification provides a mechanism to describe and discover Web resources, and it also includes a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/powder-formal/">Formal Semantics</a> document. POWDER documents are XML documents which can be automatically converted, through a GRDDL transform, into a semantically rich version in RDF (POWDER-S). The "semantics" document describes how to make such transformation. </p>

	<p>The PROV Ontology Working Group has produced 12 specifications to facilitate the interchange of provenance information in the Web (where provenance is …information about entities, activities, and people involved in producing a piece of data or thing, which can be used to form assessments about its quality, reliability or trustworthiness"). Besides having published a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/">PROVO Ontology</a> to facilitate the expression of provenance as RDF, the family of documents also define an EBNF notation "which allows serializations of PROV instances to be created in a compact manner", a set of constraints to "ensure that a PROV instance represents a consistent history of objects and their interactions that is safe to use for the purpose of logical reasoning" and statements in the PROV Data Model are seen "as atomic formulas in the sense of first-order logic […and…] the constraints and inferences specified in PROV-CONSTRAINTS as a first-order theory". 
 </p> 

<h3>ODRL Formalization</h3>
	<p>ODRL was created in in the early 2000's as an XML dialect to represent rights expressions to be used in the framework of Digital Rights Management systems; and its version 1.1 gained much spread [ODRL02]. Different ODRL profiles extended the vocabulary to satisfy the needs in different sectors. In 2011, an ODRL W3C Community Group was established, publishing soon after a new version 2.1 with major changes which included a new information model [Ianella15], a vocabulary [Ianella15b] and an Ontology [McRoberts15]. ODRL 2.1 became then a policy language.Other specifications in XML and similar to ODRL were MPEG-21 Rights Expression Language [Wang94], XACML  or MPEG-21 Contracts Expression Language [Rodríguez15]. The MPEG-21 Media Contracts Ontology [Rodriguez16] defines an ontology to guide the generation of contracts as RDF, with a similar philosophy to that of the ODRL Ontology.</p>

	<p>RDF documents instantiating the "Policy" class of the ODRL Ontology or using the XML or JSON syntaxes are called simply "ODRL Policies". The ODRL Ontology is already a formalization of the ODRL information model and vocabulary. The ontology of the version 2.1 consists of 1111 axioms with low complexity, but a comprehensive definition of each element (classes and relations) and a systematic definition of domains and ranges for the properties. Some ODRL concepts are represented as SKOS concepts ordered in SKOS collection. Reasoning with the ontology would be computationally inexpensive, but the usefulness of the possible reasoning tasks with the ontology is very limited. </p>

	<p>The ODRL 2.1 Ontology is not the first ODRL Ontology and other ontologies had been proposed before [García05][Kasten10]. However, neither these ontologies nor the ODRL 2.1 Ontology directly supported any reasoning tasks of practical use. Other more generic rights ontologiesexist, claiming tocomprise the concepts of ODRL, with the ambition of facilitating interoperability. Thus, Delgado (2003) and Nadah (2007) have proposed ontologies as a bridge to make transformation between rights expression languages like ODRL and MPEG-21 REL, whereas Rodríguez (2013) underlined the similarities of seven policy languages with an ontology design pattern. Other alternative means of achieving interoperability do not require ontologies, as Guth did (2003) defining an abstract object model.</p>

	<p>Some other formalizations of ODRL have been proposed with the purpose of determining whether a request is permitted given a set of policies and a certain history of events:we can name this task as theauthorisation decision.With that purpose, Gunter and Pucella had defined general logics for rights (2001 and 2002 respectively). Pucella then extended his work to model ODRL1.1 statements (2004) as formulas in a many-sorted first-order logic with equality,to determinewhether a permission was implied by a set of ODRL statements. Holzer et al. (2004) also enriched the authorisation decision modelling the dynamic aspects of licenses with finite-automata like structures (useful when the property of an asset is transferred, or when the number of plays is limited to a certain number of times). Chong et al. (2006) modelled licenses with multiset rewritingand logic programming (Prolog), including the ability to evaluate and merge licenses and to track the dynamic aspects of the rights evolution. Barth and Mitchell (2006) observed that the authorisation decision of a sequence of actions given a set of ODRL licenses is NP-complete because of the interval constraints, and proposed using propositional linear logic to grant efficient computability. Sheppard and Sfavi(2009) defined an algorithm for the authorisation decision with some of the most common ODRL elements, giving the pseudo-code for a virtual machine. Steyskal and Polleres (2015) defined an abstract syntax for expressing ODRL policies, where the dependencies among ODRL actions and the different conflict resolution strategies were explicitly considered in the rules for taking the authorisation decision. </p>

	<p>Besides the problems of facilitating interoperability and making the authorisation decision, other problems of interest have been modeled with formalizations of ODRL. One of them is how to evaluate the compatibility and composition of licenses, useful when handling with differently licensed content or data. In this line, Gangadharan et al. (2007)proposed a matchmaking algorithm to analyze the compatibility of licenses and make license compositions; Jamkhedkarand Heileman (2008) showed how the combination of ODRL, CreativeCommons REL and the XrML (embryo of the MPEG-21 REL) licenses was possible with an abstract model and several rules. Villata and Gandon (2012) also defined a framework with algorithms to validate compatibility and to obtain composite licenses. Rotolo et al. (2013) defined a deontic logic system for the composition of licenses, with strict rules, defasible rules and defeater rules. More recent critics </p>

	<p>It is evident that some policies can be used to grant automated access to resources. For example, verifying the execution of a payment can be automatically done. However, the satisfaction of some constraints cannot be digitally evaluated. Policies then play a double role, as automatable expressions in a computer system and as constracts with a certain legal value. Steyskal and Kirrane (2015) show how to use ODRL to specify access requests, data offers and agreements, distinguishing between enforceable and non-enforceable access policies, proposing an algorithm to auto-generate contracts for the latter.</p>

	<p>In more recent efforts, de Vos et al. (2019) transforms ODRL expressions into Answer Set Programming to model policies and check compliance – specifically in the area of personal data processing, where ODRL has also been recently used (Esteves et al. 2021). Other profiles and initiatives have been proposed (Kim et al. 2020), on despite of several limitations found by Kebede at al. (2020).</p>

	<p> In Fornara and Colombetti (2019) the  ODRL 2.2 policy language has been extended in two directions. Firstly, by inserting in the model the notion of activation event, secondly, by considering the temporal aspects of obligations, permissions, and prohibitions
(e.g. expiration dates and deadlines) as part of the application independent model of policies.
