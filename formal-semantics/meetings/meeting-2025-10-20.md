## Notes

Dicussion of Issue (Examples of formal semantics #135)[https://github.com/w3c/odrl/issues/135]

Decision:
1. The state of the world must have a unique id: accepted.
2. Dynamic values provided in the evaluation request and static values specified in the state of the world.
Dynamic value are inserted in the state of the world using the values provided as parameters by the evaluation request: accepted.

TO DO:

We discussed the necessity to decouple the definition of the semantics of ODRL from the process of evaluating it and to state it clearly in the web page on the Semantics of ODRL.

The definition of the ontologies for representing the state of the world, the evaluation request, and the evaluation report
is not part of the W3C recommendation. Moreover it is not the only way this could be done. It is required for providing the semantics of the examples. In a second phase, starting from a commonly accepted semantics of the examples provided, we will need to generalize our proposal by proposing the semantics of every possible ODRL policy.

We discussed moving the sections on the state of the world and the request for evaluation to another document in the future.
