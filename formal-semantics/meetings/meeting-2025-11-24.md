## Notes

Dicussion of Issue (Examples of formal semantics #135)[https://github.com/w3c/odrl/issues/135]

Decision:

1. We agree that, as in example C1 and C2 (https://w3c.github.io/odrl/formal-semantics/#evaluation-of-conditions-duties) the duty must be fulfilled before the permission could be used.
In case it is necessary to express that the duty (associated with a permission) can be fulfilled after the permission has been used ( e.g. play the file and pay within one month), a deadline for fulfilling the duty must be introduced.

2. We agree to start collecting types of policies that cannot be expressed with the current version of ODRL 2.2. For example: 
   - The permission to get a copy of a digital resource (some data) together with a duty to delete it after two weeks.
   - The permission to play a file only if during the process of playing the file there is an attibution of the owner of the file.
