## Agenda + Notes

#### 1. Working Drafts   


#### 1.1 [ODRL Implementation Best Practices](https://w3c.github.io/odrl/bp/)
Owner: Victor  
Status: Early Review  
Open Issues: [Github](https://github.com/w3c/odrl/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Implementation+Best+Practices%22) 
Notes: Nothing to be reported. @Victor to try to resolve or close the two open issues.


#### 1.2 [ODRL Data Spaces Profile](https://w3c.github.io/odrl/profile-dataspaces/)
Owner: Joaquín (Rodrigo speaks on behalf of Joaquín today).  
Status: Under Development. 
Open Issues: [Github](https://github.com/w3c/odrl/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Data+Spaces%22)  
Notes:
Rodrigo: No presentation will be made at the next GAIA-X Events, no relevant progress to be described. 
Victor, Andrea: The document is very sketchy, but there is potentially general interest on this profile. 
Rigo: actually sticky policies are their paradigm. 
Joshua: The meaning of some elements needs to be precised. 
Yassir: At least for most Dataspace practical ecosystems that I have seen, it's more on the stage of using ODRL for Contract Negotiation, and not granular Access/Usage Control of specific Data assets. That's also the direction the Eclipse Dataspace Protocol is moving. 
Rui: Interesting to know. I feel ODRL is very good for contract description, but didn't expect it being the best choice for contract negotiation. Would be interested to learn your experience and/or solution.
Andrea, all: Not complete agreement on the role of ontologies precising the meaning of elements 

#### 1.3 [ODRL Temporal Profile](https://w3c.github.io/odrl/profile-temporal/)
Owner: Ben  
Status: Close to Review  
Open Issues: [Github Issues](https://github.com/w3c/odrl/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Temporal+Profile%22)  
Notes: Not discussed.


#### 1.4 [ODRL Formal Semantics](https://w3c.github.io/odrl/formal-semantics/)
Owner: Nicoletta  
Status: In Progress  
Open Issues: [Github](https://github.com/w3c/odrl/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Formal+Semantics%22) 
Nicoletta: A [meeting](https://github.com/w3c/odrl/blob/master/formal-semantics/meetings/meeting-2025-10-20.md) happened where the following was agreed: the state of the world needs an id. There is static and dynamic information. Examples need to be updated. The ontologies started by Andrea and Beatriz need to be updated too (state of the world and evaluation result). 
Ben insisted on the need on of the ontology capturing information on the evaluation too. Every activity (access control, monitoring) requires a unique, possibly different semantics.  
Rigo: Decoupling evaluation and semantics is critical and good. Joshua: happy to hear that because RDF is not necessary in practical settings.
Simon: However, custom serialization loses interoperability
Next meeting to be scheduled.
 
#### 1.5 [ODRL Community Vocabulary](https://w3c.github.io/odrl/community-vocab/)
Owner: Beatriz  
Status: New
