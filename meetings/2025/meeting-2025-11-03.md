## Agenda + Notes

#### 1. Working Drafts   


#### 1.1 [ODRL Implementation Best Practices](https://w3c.github.io/odrl/bp/)
Owner: Victor  
Status: Early Review  
Open Issues: [Github](https://github.com/w3c/odrl/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Implementation+Best+Practices%22) 
Notes: Nothing to be reported. 


#### 1.2 [ODRL Data Spaces Profile](https://w3c.github.io/odrl/profile-dataspaces/)
Owner: Joaquín (Rodrigo speaks on behalf of Joaquín today).  
Status: Under Development. 
Open Issues: [Github](https://github.com/w3c/odrl/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Data+Spaces%22)  
Notes: 
A long debate took place here.
No presentation will be made at the next GAIA-X Events, no relevant progress to be described in the document edition. The document is very sketchy, but there is potentially general interest on this profile. 

The meaning of some elements needs to be precised, actually the sticky policies paradigm seem to be the correct approach.
In current Dataspace implementations, ODRL is mostly being applied for contract negotiation rather than for fine-grained access or usage control of data assets, aligning with the direction of the Eclipse Dataspace Protocol. There is general agreement that ODRL is well suited for describing contracts, though its use in negotiation raises questions — particularly regarding the limited specification and examples of ODRL:Request, and how such elements should be interpreted and compared during negotiation. The formal semantics may help clarify this, but further discussion is needed. There was also no full consensus on the role of ontologies in defining or refining the meaning of ODRL elements.

#### 1.3 [ODRL Temporal Profile](https://w3c.github.io/odrl/profile-temporal/)
Owner: Ben  
Status: Close to Review  
Open Issues: [Github Issues](https://github.com/w3c/odrl/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Temporal+Profile%22)  
Notes: Not discussed.


#### 1.4 [ODRL Formal Semantics](https://w3c.github.io/odrl/formal-semantics/)
Owner: Nicoletta  
Status: In Progress  
Open Issues: [Github](https://github.com/w3c/odrl/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Formal+Semantics%22) 
Nicoletta: A [meeting](https://github.com/w3c/odrl/blob/master/formal-semantics/meetings/meeting-2025-10-20.md) happened. In the meeting, participants agreed that the state of the world should have a unique identifier and that both static and dynamic information need to be represented. Examples and existing ontologies (covering state of the world and evaluation results) should be updated accordingly. It was emphasized that the ontology should also capture evaluation information, since each activity (such as access control or monitoring) may require its own semantics. Participants agreed that decoupling evaluation from semantics is important, though this raised questions about the trade-off between simplicity and interoperability, especially when not using RDF. The handling of streaming data was recognized as an open challenge, with references to ongoing work in the RDF Stream Processing Community Group and the Data Products specification. The next meeting was scheduled for November 24th at 12:00 UTC, with a proposal to invite experts in RDF streaming.
 
#### 1.5 [ODRL Community Vocabulary](https://w3c.github.io/odrl/community-vocab/)
Owner: Beatriz  
Status: New  
Open Issues: [Github Issues](https://github.com/w3c/odrl/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Community+Vocabulary%22)
Notes: The document needs to be updated.

#### 2. W3C Business

2.1. General Open Issues: [Github Issues](https://github.com/w3c/odrl/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AW3C)   
Notes: TPAC is taking place November 10-14 in Japan. TPAC 2027 to be held in Dublin, ODRL presence would be great.
Some break out sessions can be attended remotely [here](https://www.w3.org/2025/11/TPAC/schedule.html#wednesday).

2.2 W3C ODRL Model/Vocab Recommendation Errata: [Github Issues](https://github.com/w3c/poe/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AErratumRaised)  
Notes: No comments.

2.2 Industry Outreach: [Github Issues](https://github.com/w3c/odrl/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AIndustry)   
Notes: 
Very nice note on ODRL to be disseminated/reposted: https://www.w3.org/blog/2025/w3c-standard-odrl-policy-gaining-industry-adoption/

#### 3. Any other Business
