# ODRL Roadmap 2026

Objective: Propose a plan for the development of ODRL3 as a new W3C Recommendation

Motivation: Burgening industry adoption (see W3C blog post)

Timescale: Target W3C TPAC Meeting (Oct 2026 in Dublin) for a Proposed new Working Group Charter

Process:
 - Define current ODRL issues (that challange deployment)
 - Source ODRL Features (from current and new communities) that will provide new capabilities
  - Collect use cases and extract requirements
 - Develop a conceptual draft of ODRL3
